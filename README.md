Discord bot to summon deafened and muted individuals. Made using discord.js and hosted as an AWS Lambda function.

IMPORTANT:
You need to have two channels setup in the server called 'Portal 1' and 'Portal 2', otherwise summoning will not happen.
If the bot appears offline, the first command might fail, do not panic. The next command will work since the bot will be active.
